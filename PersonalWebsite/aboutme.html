            Hi, I'm Xin Peng, my English name is Grace.
            <br>
            I was born in Fuzhou,China. I spent half of my life in this city. Then I have been to Melbourne Australia for one and half years in high school.
            Then I came to Canada in 2017 and it is my fifth years in Canada.
            <br>
    		I am an easy-going person chill person. I am interested in trying different things, traveling to different cities, and feeling different customs. Or try different restaurants, like Korean cuisine, Japanese bbq, and French dining. Learning and feeling about a different culture which inspirate my life. I like R&B music, I always play Spotify all day. And I like yoga. It's an activity that helps me relax, makes me feel more peaceful every day, and connects the inner mind.
            <br>
            In study and work, I like teamwork. I am a good team leader. I like teamwork and can coordinate team communication.
            I can also be self-motive. When I am under pressure or encounter difficulties, I will always encourage myself and overcome difficulties. Because of the difficulty of customer service, which means I make new achievements.
