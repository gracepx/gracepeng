            Hi, I'm Xin Peng.
            <br>
            I come from Fuzhou, China, where I spent a significant part of my life. During high school, I had the chance to live in Melbourne, Australia, for about a year and a half.
            <br>Exploring new things and traveling are passions of mine. I find joy and inspiration in experiencing different cultures and trying various cuisines.Yoga and golf are my escapes for finding inner peace and relaxation. They help me unwind and recharge, especially during stressful times.

            <br>I thrive in team settings and possess strong leadership skills. My ability to solve problems and recognize others' strengths contributes to our collective success. Empathy plays a vital role in my communication with teammates, allowing me to understand their perspectives.
            
            When I face challenges, I tackle them head-on, viewing them as opportunities for personal growth. I'm driven by self-motivation and always strive to overcome obstacles."
